First, letâ€™s establish the original C++ code for reference. This is a standalone aerospace encryption program using AES-CBC with PKCS7 padding, designed for security and reliability, running from a USB stick on Windows RAM.
the x86 assembly code (using NASM syntax) for the main function and a sample supporting function (hex_to_bytes), with detailed comments mapping to the C++ code. Other functions follow a similar pattern and can be implemented by students based on this template.
Notes:

Other functions (self_test, bytes_to_hex, pkcs7_pad, print_formatted_hex) follow a similar structure: manual loops, register management, and explicit clearing.
For brevity, isxdigit is assumed as a helper; in practice, implement it or link to C library.
Compiling to .exe on Windows
To compile the assembly code into a Windows .exe:

Install NASM:
Download from nasm.us.
Add to PATH (e.g., C:\nasm).
Install MinGW (GCC for Windows):
Install via MinGW or MSYS2.
Ensure gcc is in PATH.
Install mbedTLS:
Download from tls.mbed.org.
Build with make and place libmbedcrypto.a in your project directory.
Build Script (build.bat):
bat

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
@echo off
nasm -f win32 main.asm -o main.obj
gcc -m32 main.obj -o pico_message_gadget.exe -L. -lmbedcrypto -lmsvcrt
echo Build complete. Run pico_message_gadget.exe
-f win32: Generates a 32-bit Windows object file.
-m32: Ensures 32-bit linking.
